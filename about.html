            <p>
                The MSC (Maths, Science, and Computing) competition is a fun event where students get to show what they know 
                about STEM subjects such as Maths, Science and Technology/Computing. It has different activities like quizzes 
                and project tasks that help students work together, be creative, and learn. The theme for 
                this year's event is "Change and Adapt", which goes along with STEM Week. The event will start on the 7th March 2025 
                during STEM Week, over 5 weeks and it's going to be an exciting experience for everyone.
            </p>

                The competition has two rounds: Club Competitions and Tutor Group Competitions. In Round 2, students will 
                participate within clubs such as: Science for Life Club (Science), Coding Club (Computing), STEM Club 
                (Combined), the Maths part will take place within Maths Lessons. During the first four weeks, they will take part in 
                quizzes and work on projects. At the end of the fifth week, winners will be announced. Round 1 will have quizzes 
                during Tutor Time, and the points from each tutor group will go toward winning the Faculty Trophy.
            </p>

                The MSC Competition is more than just about winning. It's about getting students excited about STEM subjects, 
                working together, solving problems, and showing what they can do. Students will have the chance to show their skills
                in quizzes and projects. The outstanding participants will get certificates, and the top Maths participants may be
                considered for the UKMT competition by the Head of Maths. The points earnt by Tutor Groups within Round 1 will go 
                towards the Faculty Trophy which is given out to the winning faculty at the end of the school year.

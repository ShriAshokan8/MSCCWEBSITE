            <p>
                The MSC (Maths, Science, and Computing) competition is a fun event where students get to show what they know about STEM subjects such as Maths, Science and Technology/Computing.
                It has different activities like quizzes and project tasks that help students work together, be creative, and learn. 
                The theme for this year's event is <strong>"Change and Adapt"</strong>, which goes along with STEM Week. 
                The event will take place from 7th March 2024 to 16th March 2024, and it's going to be an exciting experience for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The competition has two rounds: Club Competitions and Tutor Group Competitions. 
                In Round 1, students will participate within clubs such as: 
                Science for Life Club (Science), Coding Club (Computing), STEM Club (Combined), the Maths part will take place within Maths Lessons.
                During the first four weeks, they will take part in quizzes and work on projects. 
                At the end of the fifth week, winners will be announced. 
                Round 2 will have quizzes during Tutor Time, and the points from each tutor group will go toward winning the Faculty Trophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MSC competition is more than just about winning. It's about getting students excited about STEM subjects, working together, solving problems, and showing what they can do. 
                Students will have the chance to show their skills in quizzes and projects. The outstanding participants will get certificates, 
                and the top Maths participants may be considered for the UKMT competition by the Head of Maths.
                The points earnt by Tutor Groups within Round 2 will go towards the Faculty Trophy which is given out to the winning faculty at the end of the school year.

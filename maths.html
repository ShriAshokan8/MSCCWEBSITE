        <h2>Project 1 (Set 1) - Equation Escape</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong> "How would I change and adapt a board game called Equation Escape?"</p>

        <h3>Concept of Equation Escape</h3>
        <p>Equation Escape is a board game where players solve equations to unlock paths and escape a maze. The challenge is to use mathematical skills strategically to progress and win the game.</p>

        <h3>Project Task</h3>
        <p>Students must modify and adapt the game by introducing new mechanics, increasing difficulty, or adding creative twists. The goal is to make the game more engaging while maintaining its math[...]

        <h3>Possible Adaptations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjusting Difficulty Levels:</strong> Introducing beginner, intermediate, and advanced equation challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Adding a Time Limit:</strong> Players must solve equations within a set time to move forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating Different Puzzle Types:</strong> Incorporate fractions, algebra, geometry-based challenges, or real-world math problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Incorporating Power-Ups:</strong> Players can earn bonuses for solving equations quickly or correctly on the first attempt.</li>
            <li><strong>Thematic Variations:</strong> Change the game setting (e.g., space adventure, medieval escape, treasure hunt) to make it more exciting.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiplayer or Co-op Mode:</strong> Allow players to work together to solve complex equations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mini Prototype Before Final Product</h3>
        <p>Before creating the full board game, students should design a mini version of their idea on paper or using a simple digital tool. This helps plan the final product before assembling it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use drawings and sketches to outline the new board design and rules.</li>
            <li>Test the mechanics using cut-out pieces on a smaller scale.</li>
            <li>Optionally, use basic digital tools (Google Drawings, Canva, or PowerPoint) to create a rough version before building the actual game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Submission & Presentation</h3>
        <p>Students should submit their adapted version of Equation Escape in one of the following formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A written report explaining the changes and their impact on gameplay.</li>
            <li>A physical prototype of the board game.</li>
            <li>A short presentation showcasing their version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Judging Criteria</h3>
        <p>The projects will be evaluated based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creativity & Originality:</strong> How unique and engaging is the adaptation?</li>
            <li><strong>Mathematical Accuracy:</strong> Does the game reinforce proper mathematical concepts?</li>
            <li><strong>Playability & Fun Factor:</strong> Is the game enjoyable and easy to understand?</li>
            <li><strong>Presentation Quality:</strong> How well is the project explained and demonstrated?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project 2 (Set 2) - Equation Escape: Colorful Journey</h2>
        
        <h3>Concept of Equation Escape: Colorful Journey</h3>
        <p>Players are on a colorful journey to escape from a magical world by solving math equations. Instead of just moving forward with simple dice rolls or a linear path, players solve math problems to unlock different color paths that lead to the exit.</p>

        <h3>How the Game Works</h3>
        <p><strong>Game Setup:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The board consists of colored paths (e.g., red, blue, yellow, green). The objective is to follow a path from the starting point to the magic door at the end.</li>
            <li>Each color represents a different type of math problem.</li>
            <li>Start: Players begin on a single, common space, and they must choose a colored path to go down.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Movement:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players roll a dice to determine how many spaces to move along their chosen path.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Math Problems for Each Color:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Path: Simple addition problems (e.g., "What is 8 + 4?").</li>
            <li>Blue Path: Simple subtraction problems (e.g., "What is 9 - 3?").</li>
            <li>Yellow Path: Mixed problems with addition and subtraction (e.g., "What is 3 + 5 - 2?").</li>
            <li>Green Path: Slightly harder problems, like doubling numbers (e.g., "What is 4 × 2?").</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Special Color Challenges:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red: If you land on a red space, you must add 1 extra space (boost your movement).</li>
            <li>Blue: If you land on blue, you must answer two questions to move forward (this gives a bit of a challenge).</li>
            <li>Yellow: If you land here, you get to roll again if you answer correctly.</li>
            <li>Green: A "double question" challenge - answer correctly to move forward, but if wrong, you have to move back 1 space!</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Escaping the Magic World:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players must reach the magic door at the end by navigating through the different colored paths.</li>
            <li>To escape, you must solve a final multi-step problem that combines addition, subtraction, and multiplication. For example: "What is (5 + 3) × 2?"</li>
            <li>If solved correctly, the player reaches the magic door and wins the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Bonus Elements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wild Cards: Players can draw cards that give them small advantages or help with math questions (e.g., "Answer any math question correctly without rolling the dice!" or "Skip your next challenge").</li>
            <li>Cooperative Option: If players are struggling, they can help each other by combining their path colors. For example, if one player is on the red path and another is on blue, they can share answers and move forward together.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Game board: Colorful path sections that lead to the exit (either printed or drawn). - They can make this (obviously)!</li>
            <li>Dice: A regular 1-6 dice (making one can give extra points!) - They can make this!</li>
            <li>Player pieces: Tokens or figures to move along the path. - They can make this!</li>
            <li>Maths question cards: Each color path will have a set of question cards for its type (addition, subtraction, etc.). - They can make this!</li>
            <li>Wild cards: Cards that offer special powers (optional). - They can make this!</li>
            <li>Graph Paper – For design.</li>
            <li>Rulers – For precise lines.</li>
            <li>Compasses – For circular paths.</li>
            <li>Markers/Pencils – For sketching and labelling.</li>
            <li>Whiteboards/Markers – For brainstorming (Optional).</li>
            <li>Stopwatches/Timers – For time limits (Not necessary just yet, if they do want to add time limits).</li>
            <li>Cardboard – Game Pieces/Tokens – For player movement.</li>
            <li>Craft Materials – Scissors, glue, etc.</li>
            <li>A3/A4 Card (Preferably A3 Card) – For the maze board and major game components. (For each student). <strong>192 cards needed in total, 32 per class.</strong></li>
            <li>A3/A4 Paper – For extra design or puzzle sheets. (Scrap is fine). <strong>192 sheets needed in total, 32 per class.</strong></li>
            <li>Colouring Equipment – Pens and Pencils.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project 3 (Set 3) - Equation Escape: Tower Climb</h2>
        
        <h3>Concept of Equation Escape: Tower Climb</h3>
        <p>The game is about climbing a tower by solving simple maths problems. Players solve basic questions (addition, subtraction, simple multiplication) to move up. The first to reach the top wins, but the game can be easier by reducing complexity.</p>

        <h3>How the Game Works</h3>
        <p><strong>Tower Levels:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The tower is divided into 5-10 levels. Each level has a platform or step.</li>
            <li>Each player moves one step up per correct answer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Maths:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use basic addition/subtraction or suitable topics (e.g., "What is 7 + 5?").</li>
            <li>Provide multiple-choice options (3 choices) to help players with answers.</li>
            <li>Questions can have visual aids (e.g., pictures, number lines) to make the math less abstract.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Movement:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correct Answer = Move up one level.</li>
            <li>Incorrect Answer = Stay on the same level, or they can try again without losing any turns.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Power-ups & Boosts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduce a helper card that lets players skip a question if they get stuck.</li>
            <li>You can have simple "boost cards" that give players extra moves when they answer questions quickly or correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>No Time Pressure (Optional):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>There’s no rush! Players can take their time to solve the questions without a time limit.</li>
        </ul>

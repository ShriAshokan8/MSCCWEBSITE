        <h1>Maths Section</h1>
        <h2>Project - Equation Escape</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong> "How would I change and adapt a board game called Equation Escape?"</p>

        <h3>Concept of Equation Escape</h3>
        <p>Equation Escape is a board game where players solve equations to unlock paths and escape a maze. The challenge is to use mathematical skills strategically to progress and win the game.</p>

        <h3>Project Task</h3>
        <p>Students must modify and adapt the game by introducing new mechanics, increasing difficulty, or adding creative twists. The goal is to make the game more engaging while maintaining its math[...]

        <h3>Possible Adaptations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjusting Difficulty Levels:</strong> Introducing beginner, intermediate, and advanced equation challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Adding a Time Limit:</strong> Players must solve equations within a set time to move forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating Different Puzzle Types:</strong> Incorporate fractions, algebra, geometry-based challenges, or real-world math problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Incorporating Power-Ups:</strong> Players can earn bonuses for solving equations quickly or correctly on the first attempt.</li>
            <li><strong>Thematic Variations:</strong> Change the game setting (e.g., space adventure, medieval escape, treasure hunt) to make it more exciting.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiplayer or Co-op Mode:</strong> Allow players to work together to solve complex equations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mini Prototype Before Final Product</h3>
        <p>Before creating the full board game, students should design a mini version of their idea on paper or using a simple digital tool. This helps plan the final product before assembling it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use drawings and sketches to outline the new board design and rules.</li>
            <li>Test the mechanics using cut-out pieces on a smaller scale.</li>
            <li>Optionally, use basic digital tools (Google Drawings, Canva, or PowerPoint) to create a rough version before building the actual game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Submission & Presentation</h3>
        <p>Students should submit their adapted version of Equation Escape in one of the following formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A written report explaining the changes and their impact on gameplay.</li>
            <li>A physical prototype of the board game.</li>
            <li>A short presentation showcasing their version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Judging Criteria</h3>
        <p>The projects will be evaluated based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creativity & Originality:</strong> How unique and engaging is the adaptation?</li>
            <li><strong>Mathematical Accuracy:</strong> Does the game reinforce proper mathematical concepts?</li>
            <li><strong>Playability & Fun Factor:</strong> Is the game enjoyable and easy to understand?</li>
            <li><strong>Presentation Quality:</strong> How well is the project explained and demonstrated?</li>
        </ul>

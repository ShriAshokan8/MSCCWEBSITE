            <p>
                The MSC (Maths, Science, and Computing) event is a multi-round competition designed to inspire and engage students in 
                STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects. It features activities such as quizzes and project-based 
                tasks, fostering teamwork, creativity, and subject knowledge. This year's theme for the MSC event is <strong>"Change and Adapt"</strong>, 
                aligning with the theme of STEM Week. The event will run from 7th March 2024 to 16th March 2024 and aims to create an immersive 
                experience for students.
            </p>

                The competition will be organized in two rounds: Club Competitions and Tutor Group Competitions. In Round 1, students will participate 
                in their respective clubs. The first four weeks of this round will focus on subject-specific quizzes, project planning, development, 
                and presentation, with winners announced in the fifth week. Clubs involved include the Science for Life Club, Coding Club, and STEM Club, 
                with Maths quizzes/projects possibly conducted during Maths lessons. In Round 2, STEM-themed quizzes will be held during Tutor Time, and points 
                from each tutor group will contribute to the Faculty Trophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MSC event is not just about competition; it's about fostering a love for STEM subjects and encouraging students to collaborate, think critically, 
                and apply their knowledge to real-world problems. Students will have the chance to showcase their abilities in quizzes and project development, 
                with outstanding participants receiving certificates. Additionally, top Maths participants may be considered for the UKMT competition, and the 
                Faculty Trophy will be awarded to the tutor group with the highest combined score from both rounds.

            <p>
                The MSC (Maths, Science, and Computing) event is a multi-round competition designed to inspire and engage students in 
                STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects. It features activities such as quizzes and project-based 
                tasks, fostering teamwork, creativity, and subject knowledge. The theme of this event will be <strong>"Change and Adapt"</strong>, 
                which aligns with the theme of STEM Week. The event aims to highlight how STEM subjects evolve and adapt to meet the challenges of 
                the modern world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>MSC Competition</strong> is designed to offer students an engaging platform to showcase their skills across three main STEM 
                areas: Maths, Science, and Computing. Throughout the event, students will participate in subject-specific quizzes and hands-on projects 
                that encourage teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. The competition will span over five days, with each day dedicated to a 
                specific area, and a final day to celebrate their accomplishments with awards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The competition is structured to promote learning in a collaborative, supportive environment where students can foster a passion for STEM 
                subjects. With the combined effort of quizzes and project presentations, students are given the chance to explore STEM topics creatively 
                while developing important life skills such as communication and teamwork. At the end of the event, each participant will leave with a 
                sense of achievement, having contributed to a fun and inspiring experience.

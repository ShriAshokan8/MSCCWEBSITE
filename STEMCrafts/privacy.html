            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> Processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (e.g., improving our website, responding to enquiries, preventing fraud) and does not override your rights and freedoms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Who We Share Your Data With</h2>
        
        <p>We may share your personal data with the following third parties, but only when necessary:</p>
        
        <h3>Service Providers</h3>

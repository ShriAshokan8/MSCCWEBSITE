The MSC competition website is a platform dedicated to an exciting multi-day competition focusing on Maths, Science, and Computing.

It serves as a central hub where students, staff and support team members can find all the necessary information about the event. The website includes designated logins for
different user roles, providing personalized access to resources and tools based on whether the visitor is an organizer, a staff member of Year 12 assistant.

Styled with the primary colours, Red and Purple, the site aims to engage young learners in STEM subjects, offering event schedules, guidelines, and updates for participants.

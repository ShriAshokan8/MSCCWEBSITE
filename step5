Step 5 – Begin constructing the full MSC Nexus Editor using the AppFlowy engine located inside /nexus

Important:
I do NOT want any AppFlowy branding, naming, text, or visuals in the final editor.
However, you ARE allowed to use the AppFlowy engine, logic, runtime code, structures, and build assets that currently exist inside /nexus.

I want you to begin creating the FULL MSC Nexus Editor NOW.

Do NOT wait for a build. Do NOT require me to compile anything locally.
You must construct the editor files directly inside the repo using the existing AppFlowy source code, assets, and frontend logic.

Your tasks for Step 5:

1. Create a new directory:
/nexus/editor/

2. Inside /nexus/editor/, generate the following starter files:
- index.html
- editor.css
- editor.js
- msc-theme.css
- msc-ui.js

3. The editor must:
- Use the AppFlowy engine files already in the repo (Flutter JS output, wasm, runtime, or frontend libraries)
- Load the engine quietly in the background
- Wrap the engine in a new custom UI that is 100% branded as “MSC Nexus Editor”
- Never display the word “AppFlowy” anywhere
- Replace all engine-visible UI surfaces with MSC Nexus equivalents (toolbar, sidebar, menus, etc.)

4. If any AppFlowy engine UI elements cannot be removed yet, hide them with CSS in editor.css or msc-theme.css.
Use CSS overrides such as:
display: none;
visibility: hidden;
opacity: 0;

5. The initial editor UI layout must include:
- A topbar with “MSC Nexus Editor”
- A sidebar (empty for now)
- A main content region where the AppFlowy engine renders pages

6. Inside editor.js and msc-ui.js:
Implement the loader that:
- Initializes the AppFlowy engine from inside the repo
- Connects it into the content region
- Ensures no AppFlowy-branded UI elements appear

7. You are allowed to create new JS files that integrate the engine with our custom UI.
If needed, create a subfolder:
/nexus/editor/engine-bindings/
and place integration code there.

8. For ANY AppFlowy-branded assets (icons, logos, names):
Replace them with neutral SVGs or MSC-branded colours.
All replacements must be created inside /nexus/editor/assets/

9. This step does NOT require full functionality yet.
Just the initial structure and integration scaffolding for the MSC Nexus Editor.

10. Make no references to "AppFlowy" in ANY new files.
This must look like a fresh, standalone editor called:
“MSC Nexus Editor”
internally and externally.

Commit the new editor folder and scaffolding as Step 5.

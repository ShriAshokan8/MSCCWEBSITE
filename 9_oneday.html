            <h2>1-Day MSC Competition Plan (9:30 AM to 4:30 PM)</h2>

            <h3>9:30 AM - 9:45 AM: Opening Ceremony (15 minutes)</h3>
            <p>A short welcome speech to explain the competition, introduce the judges, and go over the rules.</p>

            <h3>9:45 AM - 11:30 AM: Quiz Time (1 hour 45 minutes)</h3>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                All 20 teams answer Maths, Science, and Computing questions together in the first part (1 hour).<br>
                The top 10 teams then do a quick quiz round (30 minutes) for extra points.
            </p>

            <h3>11:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Lunch Break (1 hour)</h3>
            <p>Everyone eats, chats, and gets ready for the big project presentations.</p>

            <h3>12:30 PM - 3:15 PM: Project Presentations (2 hours 45 minutes)</h3>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                All 20 teams will show their projects to all the judges and other teams.<br>
                Each team gets 6 minutes: 4 minutes to explain their project and 2 minutes to answer questions.<br>
                After every 7 teams, we’ll have a 5-minute break to reset and keep on track.
            </p>

            <h3>3:15 PM - 3:30 PM: Short Break (15 minutes)</h3>
            <p>A quick break to relax before the finale.</p>

            <h3>3:30 PM - 4:30 PM: Awards and Finale (1 hour)</h3>
            <p><strong>What happens:</strong><br>
                Announce the quiz winners (Top 3 teams).<br>
                Announce the best projects (Best Overall, Runner-Up, Most Creative).<br>
                Give out trophies, medals, and certificates.<br>
                Finish with a thank-you speech.
            </p>

            <h3>How This Will Work</h3>

            <h4>Quiz:</h4>
            <p>Teams answer questions at the same time in the first part. The second part is for the top teams.<br>
                Answers are scored quickly so we stay on time.
            </p>

            <h4>Project Presentations:</h4>
            <p>Every team gets the same amount of time (6 minutes).<br>
                A timer will help teams know when their time is up.
            </p>

            <h4>Judges:</h4>
            <p>All the judges will watch every project and write their scores right after each one.</p>

            <h3>What’s Important</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep track of time!</strong> Everyone has to follow the schedule so we can finish on time.</li>
                <li><strong>Be prepared!</strong> Teams should practice their presentations to fit within 6 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
